What time is it? Who knows?
Time is hard. And important.

* A Brief History of Time

* Given nothing, how do you know when it is?

- Measure Earth rotation period (Apparent solar day)
- Measure Earth orbit period
- Measure Moon phase

All of these are bad.

* Solar time

Apparent solar day varies throughout the year.

Average across the year to give mean solar time

* Universal time

Introduced in 1935, consolidation of historical use of Greenwich as Mean Time.

Observational.

- Uses stars  instead of the sun, because the sun is flakey and unrelable
- UT0: Measure the solar year by observing a number of stars / radio sources, from a fixed point on Earth
- UT1: There's no such thing as a fixed point on earth, correct for polar motion. Observation of 212 quasars (now 3,414 quasars) *International Celestial Reference Frame*
- UT1R: Forgot about the tides, smooth them out
- UT2: Erk, seasons, smooth them out

* Pre-1952

Everyone assumed that the Earth's orbit and rotation were uniform.

Problems (1927): 

- Length of the day is irregular
- Length of day is slowing down over time
- The 'solar second' isn't constant

Different ways of measuring the length of a second results in different answers.

* Ephemeris Time (1952)

Attempt to standardise the length of a second

- Based on observations of the Sun at the turn of the 20th century
- Everything pinned to the length of the tropical (solar) year 1900
- Complex equations to 'correct' observed solar year (universal time) to 'ephermeral year'
- 1 ephemeris day = 86,400 seconds
- 1 second = 1/31556925.975 of the solar year in 1900
- In 1960, changed to 1/31556925.9747 of the solar year

* Ephemeris Time - Universal Time

* Caesium clocks!

First introduced in 1955 and proved that Earth rotational fluctuation is essentially random.

In 1968, 1 SI second was defined:

  The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation 
  corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of
  the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.

Subsequent footnote in 1997:

  This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0K.

* International Atomic Time (TAI)

Defined as 0 = 01/01/1958 00:00:00 (UT2)

(Î”T was about 32 seconds at that point)

* Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

Non observational time (unlike UT1), and therefore drifts away from UT1.

* Computers are stupid

* Unix time

Number of seconds since 01/01/1970 00:00:00 UTC, not counting leap seconds

- Designed to store arbitrary points in time at any point after the epoch
- 1 day exactly 86,400 seconds
- Also designed to allow easy interval calculation. 19/06/2015 -> 19/06/2016 = 366 days = 31,622,400 unix seconds
- Midnight is always a multiple of 86,400
- Discontinuous
- *Ambiguous!*

* Leap second

  31/12/1998 23:59:59	->	915,148,799
  31/12/1998 23:59:60	->	915,148,800
  01/01/1999 00:00:00	->	915,148,800
  01/01/1999 00:00:01	->	915,148,801

What point in time is 915,148,800.5?

* Solutions

How can we solve this?

* Use TAI

TAI is awesome

- Never ambiguous
- Continuous
- Difficult to know where the sun is for a given future TAI value

Added in linux 3.10 (June 2013)

  clock_gettime(CLOCK_TAI, &t)  

* Clock Slewing

Lie about the length of a second in order to preserve continuity
