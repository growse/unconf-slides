                                              Paris, 5 January 2015
                                                           
                                              Bulletin C 49
                                
 To authorities responsible for the measurement and distribution of time                                         


                                   UTC TIME STEP
                            on the 1st of July 2015
                      

 A positive leap second will be introduced at the end of June 2015.
 The sequence of dates of the UTC second markers will be:		
		
                          2015 June 30,     23h 59m 59s
                          2015 June 30,     23h 59m 60s
                          2015 July  1,      0h  0m  0s
              
 The difference between UTC and the International Atomic Time TAI is:

  from 2012 July 1,    0h UTC, to 2015 July 1  0h UTC  : UTC-TAI = - 35s
  from 2015 July 1,    0h UTC, until further notice    : UTC-TAI = - 36s 


  
 Leap seconds can be introduced in UTC at the end of the months of December 
 or June, depending on the evolution of UT1-TAI. Bulletin C is mailed every 
 six months, either to announce a time step in UTC or to confirm that there 
 will be no time step at the next possible date.
